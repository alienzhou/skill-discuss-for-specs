## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# npx one-liner (recommended)
npx @vibe-x/discuss-for-specs install -p cursor
```

> Replace `cursor` with your platform: `claude-code`, `cline`, `kilocode`, `opencode`, `codex`, `trae`, `qoder`, `roo-code`, `codeflicker`. See [Platform Support](#-platform-support) for details.

### Start a Discussion

Once installed, simply tell your AI:

> "Enter discussion mode. I want to design [your topic]."

Or in Chinese:

> "进入讨论模式。我想讨论 [你的主题]。"

The Agent will guide you through a structured conversation, tracking decisions and progress automatically.

### What Happens

```
You:   "Design a caching system"          (just the topic)
         │
Agent: "What's the primary driver?        (Agent proposes, asks)
        Performance? Cost? Reliability?"
         │
You:   "Read-heavy, for API responses"    (you just decide)
         │
Agent: "Cache-aside vs Read-through..."   (Agent digs deeper)
        ┌─────── Progress Tracked ───────┐
        │ ✅ Read-heavy API caching       │
        │ 🔄 Caching pattern selection    │
        │ 📋 TTL strategy, Invalidation  │
        └─────────────────────────────────┘
         │
       .....

😊 LOW cognitive load: Agent thinks, Agent asks, Agent tracks, You decide
```

All discussions are organized into structured files:

```
.discuss/caching-system/
├── outline.md              # Live progress
└── decisions/
    ├── D01-cache-pattern.md
    ├── D02-storage-choice.md
    └── D03-ttl-strategy.md
```

---

## 📖 More Installation Options

```bash
npm install -g @vibe-x/discuss-for-specs
discuss-for-specs install -p cursor

## 💡 Why Discussion Mode?

### The Problem

In **Spec Driven Development (SDD)**, generating high-quality specifications is a well-known challenge:

- **Good Specs are powerful**: Complete, rich specifications dramatically improve code generation quality, task completion rates, and enable solving higher complexity problems
- **But creating them is hard**: Generating comprehensive, well-thought-out Specs efficiently remains difficult and cognitively demanding
- **The missing piece**: How do we produce high-quality Specs without overwhelming cognitive load?

### The Solution

This project introduces **Discussion Mode** — an AI-facilitated conversation approach that helps you iteratively develop clear, actionable specifications. It solves three critical problems:

#### 1. Agent-Driven Proactivity

The AI Agent actively drives the discussion forward:

- **Agent proposes**: Continuously provides solutions, alternatives, and ideas
- **Human decides**: You only need to select, confirm, or answer questions
- **Guided refinement**: Through this guided process, you naturally deepen and perfect technical solutions
- **Reduced cognitive load**: You stay in the decision-maker role while the Agent handles the mental heavy lifting

#### 2. State Management & Progress Tracking

Never lose track in deep discussions:

- **Maintains context**: Continuously tracks discussion state through structured outlines
- **Decision precipitation**: Automatically captures and documents confirmed decisions
- **Progress awareness**: Always knows where you are and what questions remain
- **No details lost**: Deep, long-running discussions stay organized without effort
- **Low-cost depth**: Engage in thorough exploration without worrying about losing the thread

#### 3. Progressive Enhancement

Flexible and adaptive to your workflow:

- **Start anytime**: Before Spec generation, during development, while debugging, or when analyzing problems
- **Controllable depth**: Exit and precipitate decisions whenever ready, or continue discussing until every detail is 100% confirmed
- **Always relevant**: Effective whether you have a vague idea or a concrete challenge

### 👀 See the Difference

#### Conversation Flow

**Without Discussion Mode** — You drive everything:

```
You ──────►  "I need to design a caching system. I'm thinking about
             using Redis, but I'm not sure about the TTL strategy.
             Should I use lazy expiration or active expiration?
             Also, what about cache invalidation patterns? And
             I need to consider the read/write ratio..."

             (You must think of all questions yourself)
             (You must structure your own thoughts)
             (You must drive the conversation)
                       │
                       ▼
Agent ────►  [Responds to what you asked]
                       │
                       ▼
You ──────►  "OK, but what about... wait, I forgot to ask about..."

             (You need to remember everything)
             (You need to discover all edge cases)
             (You might miss important aspects)
                       │
                       ▼
                     .....

😓 HIGH cognitive load: You think, you ask, you track, you remember
```

**With Discussion Mode** — Agent drives, you decide:

```
You ──────►  "Design a caching system"  (That's it. Just the topic.)
                       │
                       ▼
Agent ────►  "Let me understand the problem space first.

             💡 What's the primary driver for caching?
                - Performance optimization?
                - Cost reduction?
                - Reliability improvement?

             💡 I notice we should clarify the read/write ratio early -
                this fundamentally affects architecture choices.

             ❓ Is this more read-heavy or write-heavy?"
                       │
                       ▼
You ──────►  "Read-heavy, for API responses"  (Simple answer)
                       │
                       ▼
Agent ────►  "Good. For read-heavy API caching, there's something you
             might not have considered:

             💡 Cache-aside vs Read-through patterns have very different
                invalidation complexity. Let me explain the tradeoffs...

             ┌────────────── Progress Tracked ──────────────┐

             └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘"
                       │
                       ▼
You ──────►  "The first one"  (Simple choice)
                       │
                       ▼
                     .....

😊 LOW cognitive load: Agent thinks, Agent asks, Agent tracks, You decide

## 🔍 Discussion Mode vs. Specs

Discussion Mode is **not a replacement for Specs** — it's the **upstream decision layer** that makes Specs easier to write.

|                          | Discussion Mode                 | Specs                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Process (explore, decide)       | Artifact (document, execute) |
| **Core question**  | "What to decide & why?"         | "What to build & how?"       |
| **Primary output** | `outline.md` + `decisions/` | Structured spec document     |
| **When to use**    | Uncertainty is high             | Decisions are clear          |

### Workflow in SDD

```
Discuss → Precipitate decisions → Generate/update Spec → Implement → (loop back if needed)
```

This project is **tool-agnostic**: combine it with any Spec template, IDE workflow, or spec generator you already use.
