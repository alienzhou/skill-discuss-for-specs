  - Useful for unsupported platforms or custom deployment scenarios

- **Workspace detection improvement** - Enhanced workspace root detection
  - Now supports stdin JSON (`workspace_roots`, `workspaceRoots`) from platforms
  - Priority-based detection: stdin > environment variables > cwd

- **Integration tests enhancement** - Improved test coverage
  - Python: 107 tests
  - Node.js: 61 tests

### Changed
