## 📝 Precipitation Discipline

### Proactive Documentation
Don't wait to be reminded. After each round, ask yourself:
- "Did we reach any consensus this round?"
- "Have I documented confirmed decisions in `decisions/`?"

### Self-Check Trigger
Every 2-3 rounds of discussion, review:
- If outline shows multiple ✅ Confirmed items but `decisions/` is empty → Create documents now
- If a decision was confirmed 3+ rounds ago but not documented → Document it immediately

### The Rule
**Consensus reached = Decision documented.** 
No delay, no exceptions.
